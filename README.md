**FIT-ME APPLICATION**
In these modern days when people all over the world have become so much concerned
about their health and diet, it is obvious that they continually seek out for a Workout/Gym
platform.
This FIT-ME management system is an easy way to use gym and health membership system.
It can help to keep the records of registered members, guidance which exercise and muscle
groups to work out together, how much weight loss is required, their diet plans, logs of calories,
daily targets to achieve. So, keeping in mind the main features of FIT-ME are guidance to their
members about the
 Health and fitness checklist
 Weekly/Monthly Diet plan
 Daily Exercise chart
 Weight gain/loss plans
 Nutrient/Calories intake logs
 and many more

**FIT-ME** should be designed to facilitate a workout application to automate its operations of
keeping records and store them in the form of a large and user-friendly database further
facilitating easy access to the personnel.

#Objective
The objective of the FIT-ME is to provide a system which handles the information of the
members using the application and maintaining their health care.2. Case Study
Due to Covid-19 and closure of indoor gyms, an owner of a Gym wants to make
an application for his institute, so that members can access all fitness information and
guidance related to workout at home. His objective is to provide his registered members
the functionality to manage schedules, memberships, and other facilities.
To use FIT-ME, members information needs to be stored in the database. After
initial registration, members are allowed to set a workout plan. The member can either
create a plan of their own, or follow one already made (by another user, or by trained
staff). While creating/viewing the plan, the member will be able to see what muscle
groups need to be worked out, which exercise will work on the muscle group chosen, and
even which equipment is required for a specific exercise. This plan will dictate what
exercises the member needs to practice, and how frequently. Moreover, the plan also has
details on the quantities of nutritional intake the member is allowed for optimal weight
control/loss. Based on the plan chosen, there will be daily targets set for the user,
notifying them of the exact exercises they need to do, in what order and for how long
they need to work out and exactly what nutritional intake they are allowed. The members
will then log their progress daily, mentioning to what degree they were able to meet the
daily target. This log will allow the members progress to be tracked, allowing detailed
reports, such as BMI change over time, muscle gain over time, weight loss over time, etc.
